		<p>Although conventional supermarkets are usually more convenient than your local farmer’s market, more markets have appeared throughout Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island. When researching the benefits of farmer’s markets over conventional supermarkets, the health benefits are evident. Farmer’s markets provide the community with fresher, healthier and more nutritious food.</p>

		<p>My intent for choosing this topic is to show the importance of local markets and how they effect consumers, farmers, and the community as a whole. I often reflect on my own personal experience of studying abroad in Florence, Italy; my apartment sat immediately adjacent to a local farm stand. The convenience was favorable as I was buying fresh local produce for cooking with relative ease. The city's largest market, Mercado Central, contained numerous merchants with various produce. The vendors carried different fruits, assorted veggies, fresh meats, aged cheeses, organic eggs, exotic spices and much, much more. While vacationing in Montauk I experienced my first Long Island market. This Farmer’s Market located in the heart of town was my favorite. In addition to the produce it contained local artists, home-brewed beverages, and even freshly squeezed lemonade; a true representation of the local community. My goal is to shed light on the benefits of supporting your community by buying locally.</p>

		<p>In gathering research needed to prove the advantage of farmers market’s, I contacted those who would know best, farmers. My conversations began with Phil Schmitt of Riverhead, and Paulette Satur of Cutchogue who disclosed their extensive histories in the farming industry. Other people I spoke with are market coordinators Lona Graepel (G&G LI Winter Markets), Greg Sandor (Cornell University Cooperative) and Natasha Beccaria (LI Farm Bureau). Each discussed why they are so passionate about farmer’s markets. To expand my knowledge I traveled across Long Island to see what each market had to offer.</p>

		<p>To make sure my research is recognized by Long Islanders, I have created an ad campaign to help support the seed. I developed a poster representing all of Long Island’s local markets, as well as an editorial to provide more information on the topic. I have four different ads highlighting a different subject: The Sense of Community Farmer’s Markets Gives Us, The Distance Fresh Local Food Travels, The Profit That Farmers Receive at a Local Market, and The Food Security That Makes These Markets Accessible for Everyone. My poster provides the available Farmer’s Market locations in Nassau and Suffolk county. Some of these markets are in specific months only, but you can always find one to shop at!
		The foodie inside of me enjoyed speaking to these knowledgable people and traveling to these local markets. Buying locally is affordable, healthy, fresh and as convenient as a super market. I will forever support the seed.</p>
